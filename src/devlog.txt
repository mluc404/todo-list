feat: minimum functionality

    Created barebone features:
    - Take input task details via a form
    - Generate a task object upon form submission
    - Display the task immediately in DOM

TODO: 
    - For main section:
        - Add more features inside the form: dueDate, priority 
        - Diplay those additional features
        - Make form into a dialog
        - Create a button to open that form
    
    - Add a side bar:
        - A nav bar with 2 tabs: Today, Projects
        - Fix nav bar bg height not 100% when dialog extends body height
------

feat: separate 2 main pages: Today and Projects

    - Created sidebar with nav buttons
    - Put task creating form inside a dialog
    - Toggle Today page and Project page visibility
TODO:
    - Seperate functionalities into modules
    - Continue working on features inside the dialog form

------

refactor(task-display): use DOM methods for task display and removal

    - Replaced innerHTML with createElement/append for task display
    - Separated removeTask into its own function
    - Improved performance and modularity
